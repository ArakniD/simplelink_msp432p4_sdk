 *  ======== mcpi.bld ========
 *  This script is run prior to all build scripts. It sets host-system-
 *  independent values for targets and platforms, then it attempts to
 *  find the host-system-specific user.bld script that sets rootDirs.
 *
 *  These settings may be a function of the following global variables:
 *
 *	environment a hash table of environment strings
 *
 *	arguments   an array of string arguments to the _config.bld script
 *		    initialized as follows:
 *		        arguments[0] - the file name of the _config.bld script
 *		        arguments[1] - the first argument specified in XDCARGS
 *		            :
 *		        arguments[n] - the n'th argument in XDCARGS
 *
 *	Build	    an alias for xdc.om.xdc.bld.BuildEnvironment
