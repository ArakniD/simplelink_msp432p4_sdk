     *  All build commands returned within a command set

     *  the value of this target's `cc.cmd` string.

     *  located along a path constructed from this target's `pathPrefix`.

     *  environment variable set by the `xdc` command (type 'xdc -n' to
     *  see this).

     *
     *  To avoid unnecessary build time overhead, these files are not always
     *  generated; by default, they are only generated for "debug" profiles.
     *  The generation of these files is controlled by the
     *  `{@link xdc.cfg.Program#gen}` configuration parameter.  To force these
     *  files to be generated for a particular executable, add the following
     *  line to the executable's program configuration script:
     *  @p(code)
     *      Program.gen.debuggerFiles = true;
     *  @p
     *  It is also possible to control the generation via build options; see

     *  how to create and use these templates.

     *  ======== extensions ========
     *  File extensions recognized by TI targets
     *
     *  @a(TI Specifics)
     *  For TI targets, the `typ` string field of an
     *  `xdc.bld.ITarget.Extension` structure may be of the form
     *  `"<cmd>:<langOpt>"` where `<cmd>` is one of `"asm"`, `"c"`, `"cpp"`,
     *  and `<langOpt>` is the language option used to identify the source
     *  language of a source file.  This allows one to explicitly control the
     *  language flag passed to the compiler based on a source file's
     *  extension; in particular, one can define separate source extensions
     *  for "linear" and "scheduled" assembly files, or simply cause `".s62"`
     *  files to be treated as "linear" assembly rather than "scheduled"
     *  assembly.
     *
     *  For example,
     *  @p(code)
     *  tiTargets.C62.extensions[".s62"] = {suf: ".s62", typ: "asm:-fl"};
     *  @p
     *  causes all `".s62"` files to be treated as linear assembly.
     *
     *  If no ':' appears in the `typ` string, a default will be used:
     *  `"-fa"` for `"asm"` files `"-fc"` for `"c"` files, and `"-fp"` for
     *  `"cpp"` files.

    /*!
     *  ======== versionMap ========
     *  Map of TI compiler version numbers to compatibility keys.
     *
     *  This map translates version string information from the compiler
     *  into a compatibility key.  The compatibility key is used to validate
     *  consistency among a collection of packages used in a configuration.
     *
     *  TI compiler strings are formed by parsing the output of the
     *  compiler's --compiler_revision option and creating a string of the
     *  form:
     *  @p(code)
     *      <comp>_<ver>
     *  @p
     *  where `<comp>` is the first word of the output and `<ver>` is the
     *  version number that appears on this same line.
     *
     *  There are two forms of version numbers output by the TI code gen
     *  tools; an "old" style that is of the form "<major>.<minor>" and a
     *  new style of the form "<major>.<minor>.<update>[.<branch>][<qual>],
     *  where <major>, <minor>, <update>, and <branch> are non-negative
     *  integers and <qual> is of  the form "[IBAP]<yyddd>", and <yyddd>
     *  is the last two digits of the year concatenated with the number of
     *  the day.
     *
     *  If a compiler version is not found in this map the default is
     *  "1,0,<major>.<minor>" for old style version numbers, and
     *  "1,0,<major>.<minor>,<update>[.<branch>][,<yyddd>]" for new style
     *  version numbers.
     *
     *  The user only needs to extend this table when a significant
     *  incompatibility occurs (and this package doesn't know about it) or
     *  when two versions of the compiler should be treated as 100%
     *  compatible.
