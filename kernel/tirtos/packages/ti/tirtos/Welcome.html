            <p>The TI-RTOS delivers components which enable engineers to develop
               applications on Texas Instruments micro-controller devices.
               The SDK is compromised of multiple products and examples on how
               to use these products.</p>

            <form>
                <p>Navigate to the <a>System Overview</a> screen which depicts
                   all of the core components of the TI-RTOS.  On this page, you
                   can add any of these components into your application's
                   configuration by right-clicking on one and selecting "Use".
                   Clicking on any component will bring you to its corresponding
                   home page, where you can dive deeper into the configuration
                   for that particular piece of software.</p>

                <p>Note that you may freely move between the different component
                   views, and selecting options in one view will immediately
                   update the other views' settings. You may return to the
                   initial TI-RTOS home view at any time by clicking on the
                   Home icon in the upper right corner of the config tool
                   window. Note that various warnings about your configuration
                   may appear in the CCS Problems window.  If this window is not
                   visible, you can make it so by selecting Window->Show
                   View->Problems.</p>
