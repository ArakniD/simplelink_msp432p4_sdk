        <form>
            <p>SYS/BIOS is a scalable real-time kernel. It is designed to be used by
               applications that require real-time scheduling and synchronization or realtime
               instrumentation. SYS/BIOS provides preemptive multi-threading,
               hardware abstraction, real-time analysis, and configuration tools. SYS/BIOS
               is designed to minimize memory and CPU requirements on the target.</p>

                <p>Navigate to the <a>System Overview</a> screen that depicts all of the core modules in SYS/BIOS.
                You can add any of these modules to your configuration by right-clicking on it and
                selecting "Use". You can configure any module by clicking on it.
                At minimum, two different views are then available to choose from:</p>
                <li style='text' value='1.'><b>Basic.</b>  This view includes all of the configuration settings that most users will need.</li>
                <li style='text' value='2.'><b>Advanced.</b>  This view always includes every configuration setting in a generic table format.</li>
                <p>Note that you may freely move between the different views, and selecting options in one view will immediately update the
                other views' settings. You may return to the initial home view at any time by clicking on the Home icon in the upper right
                corner of the config tool window. Note that various warnings about your configuration may appear in the CCS Problems window.
                If this window is not visible, you can make it so by selecting Window->Show View->Problems.</p>
