/*! ======== BIOS ========
 *  SYS/BIOS Top-Level Manager
 *
 *  This module is responsible for setting up global parameters
 *  pertaining to SYS/BIOS and for performing the SYS/BIOS startup
 *  sequence.
 *
 *  SYS/BIOS configures the
 *  {@link xdc.runtime.Memory#defaultHeapInstance Memory.defaultHeapInstance}
 *  using a {@link ti.sysbios.heaps.HeapMem HeapMem} instance of size
 *  {@link #heapSize}.
 *
 *  The SYS/BIOS startup sequence is logically divided into two phases: those
 *  operations that occur prior to the application's "main()" function being
 *  called, and those operations that are performed after the application's
 *  "main()" function is invoked.
 *
 *  The "before main()" startup sequence is governed completely by the RTSC
 *  runtime package's {@link xdc.runtime.Startup Startup} module.
 *
 *  The "after main()" startup sequence is governed by SYS/BIOS and is
 *  initiated by an explicit call to the {@link #start BIOS_start()} function
 *  at the end of the application's main() function.
 *
 *  Control points are provided at various places in each of the two startup
 *  sequences for user startup operations to be inserted.
 *
 *  The RTSC runtime startup sequence is as follows:
 *
 *  @p(nlist)
 *  - Immediately after CPU reset, perform target-specific CPU
 *  initialization (beginning at c_int00).
 *  - Prior to cinit(), run the user-supplied "reset functions"
 *  (see {@link xdc.runtime.Reset#fxns Reset.fxns}).
 *  - Run cinit() to initialize C runtime environment.
 *  - Run the user-supplied "first functions"
 *  (see {@link xdc.runtime.Startup#firstFxns Startup.firstFxns}).
 *  - Run all the module initialization functions.
 *  - Run pinit().
 *  - Run the user-supplied "last functions"
 *  (see {@link xdc.runtime.Startup#lastFxns Startup.lastFxns}).
 *  - Run main().
 *  @p
 *
 *  The SYS/BIOS startup sequence begins at the end of main() when
 *  BIOS_start() is called:
 *
 *  @p(nlist)
 *  - Run the user-supplied "startup functions"
 *  (see {@link #startupFxns BIOS.startupFxns}).
 *  - Enable Hardware Interrupts.
 *  - Enable Software Interrupts. If the system supports Software Interrupts
 *  (Swis) (see {@link #swiEnabled BIOS.swiEnabled}), then the SYS/BIOS
 *  startup sequence enables Swis at this point.
 *  - Timer Startup. If the system supports Timers, then at this point all
 *  statically configured timers are initialized per their
 *  user-configuration.
 *  If a timer was configured to start "automatically", it is started here.
 *  - Task Startup. If the system supports Tasks
 *  (see {@link #taskEnabled BIOS.taskEnabled}),
 *  then task scheduling begins here. If there are no statically or
 *  dynamically created Tasks in the system, then execution proceeds
 *  directly to the Idle loop.
 *  @p
 *
 *  @a(Note)
 *  Local variables defined in main() no longer exist once BIOS_start() is
 *  called. The RAM where main's local variables reside is reassigned for
 *  use as the interrupt stack during the execution of BIOS_start().
 *
 *  Below is a configuration script excerpt that installs a user-supplied
 *  startup function at every possible control point in the RTSC and
 *  SYS/BIOS startup sequence:
 *
 *  @p(code)
 *  // get handle to xdc Startup module
 *  var Startup = xdc.useModule('xdc.runtime.Startup');
 *
 *  // install "reset function"
 *  Startup.resetFxn = '&myReset';
 *
 *  // install a "first function"
 *  var len = Startup.firstFxns.length
 *  Startup.firstFxns.length++;
 *  Startup.firstFxns[len] = '&myFirst';
 *
 *  // install a "last function"
 *  var len = Startup.lastFxns.length
 *  Startup.lastFxns.length++;
 *  Startup.lastFxns[len] = '&myLast';
 *
 *  // get handle to SYS/BIOS module
 *  var BIOS = xdc.useModule('ti.sysbios.BIOS');
 *
 *  // install a SYS/BIOS startup function
 *  BIOS.addUserStartupFunction('&myBiosStartup');

     *  in the TI RTS library. The gate will be used to guarantee re-entrancy
     *  of the RTS APIs.
     *
     *  The type of gate depends on the type of threads that are going to
     *  be calling into the RTS library.  For example, if both Swi and Task
     *  threads are going to be calling the RTS library's printf, GateSwi
     *  should be used. In this case, Hwi threads are not impacted (i.e.
     *  disabled) during the printf calls from the Swi or Task threads.
     *
     *  If NoLocking is used, the RTS lock is not plugged and re-entrancy for
     *  the TI RTS library calls are not guaranteed. The application can plug
     *  the RTS locks directly if it wants.
     *
     *  Numerous gate types are provided by SYS/BIOS.  Each has its advantages
     *  and disadvantages.  The following list summarizes when each type is
     *  appropriate for protecting an underlying non-reentrant RTS library.
     *  @p(dlist)
     *      - {@link #GateHwi}:
     *        Interrupts are disabled and restored to maintain re-entrancy.
     *        Use if only making RTS calls from a Hwi, Swi and/or Task.
     *
     *      - {@link #GateSwi}:
     *        Swis are disabled and restored to maintain re-entrancy. Use if
     *        only making RTS calls from a Swi and/or Task.
     *
     *      - {@link #GateMutex}:
     *        A single mutex is used to maintain re-entrancy.  Use if only
     *        making RTS calls from a Task.  Blocks only Tasks that are
     *        also trying to execute critical regions of RTS library.
     *
     *      - {@link #GateMutexPri}:
     *        A priority inheriting mutex is used to maintain re-entrancy.
     *        Blocks only Tasks that are also trying to execute critical
     *        regions of RTS library.  Raises the priority of the Task that
     *        is executing the critical region in the RTS library to the
     *        level of the highest priority Task that is block by the mutex.
     *  @p
     *
     *  The default value of rtsGateType depends on the type of threading
     *  model enabled by other configuration parameters.
     *  If {@link #taskEnabled} is true, {@link #GateMutex} is used.
     *  If {@link #swiEnabled} is true and {@link #taskEnabled} is false:
     *  {@link #GateSwi} is used.
     *  If both {@link #swiEnabled} and {@link #taskEnabled} are false:
     *  {@link xdc.runtime#GateNull} is used.
     *
     *  If {@link #taskEnabled} is false, the user should not select
     *  {@link #GateMutex} (or other Task level gates). Similarly, if
     *  {@link #taskEnabled} and {@link #swiEnabled}are false, the user
