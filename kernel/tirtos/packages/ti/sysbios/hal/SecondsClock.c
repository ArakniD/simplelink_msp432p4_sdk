     *  Calculate the clock drift:
     *
     *  drift = timerFreq - clockFreq * clockTimerPeriod
     *
     *  Example: The timer frequency is 32Khz (frequency is actually 32768),
     *  and clock tick is 1 millisecond.  The timer period register will be
     *  set to 32.  The drift is:
     *      32768 - 1000 * 32 = 768
     *
     *  This means that our 'second' is really short by 768 timer ticks, or
     *  768 / 32768 of a second.  (This problem would be easily solved by just
     *  setting the period of the SecondsClock to 1024 msecs instead of 1000
     *  msecs, but it serves as a simple example.)
     *
     *  If the drift is negative, our seconds are too long.  For example, if
     *  the timer period register were 33 in the above example instead of 32,
     *  we would get
     *      drift = 32768 - 1000 * 33 = -768
     *
     *  To adjust the seconds, we will periodically add (drift > 0) or subtract
     *  (drift < 0) a second.  The period to do this will be:
     *
     *      c1 = floor(timer freq / |drift|)
     *
     *  In the above example (for both 32 and 33 timer periods), we will adjust
     *  every floor(32768 / 768) = 42 seconds.
     *
     *  In this example, we are adjusting a little too quickly, since
     *  32768 / 768 = 42 2/3.  Too compensate, periodically, we will adjust by
     *  not adding or subtracting a second.
     *
     *  To calculate the period for not adjusting:  Calculate what the
     *  2nd drift would be after the first adjustment:
     *
     *      drift2 = timerFreq - c1 * |drift|
     *
     *  drift2 is accumulated every c1 seconds.  If drift2 != 0, set
     *
     *      c2 = floor(timerFreq / drift2)
     *
     *  and every c1 * c2 seconds, do not do the adjustment.
     *
     *  If we wanted, we could continue in this manner, calculating
     *      drift3 = timerFreq - c2 * |drift2|
     *      c3 = floor(timerFreq / drift3)
     *
     *  and every c1 * c2 * c3 seconds, do the adjustment.
