/*!
 *  ======== Task ========
 *  Task Manager.
 *
 *  The Task module makes available a set of functions that manipulate task
 *  objects accessed through pointers of type {@link #Handle}. Tasks represent
 *  independent threads of control that conceptually execute functions in
 *  parallel within a single C program; in reality, concurrency is achieved
 *  by switching the processor from one task to another.
 *
 *  All tasks executing within a single program share a common set of
 *  global variables, accessed according to the standard rules of scope
 *  defined for C functions.
 *
 *  Each task is in one of five modes of execution at any point in time:
 *  running, ready, blocked, terminated, or inactive. By design, there is
 *  always one
 *  (and only one) task currently running, even if it is only the idle task
 *  managed internally by Task. The current task can be suspended from
 *  execution by calling certain Task functions, as well as functions
 *  provided by other modules like the Semaphore or Event Modules.
 *  The current task
 *  can also terminate its own execution. In either case, the processor
 *  is switched to the highest priority task that is ready to run.
 *
 *  You can assign numeric priorities to tasks. Tasks are
 *  readied for execution in strict priority order; tasks of the same
 *  priority are scheduled on a first-come, first-served basis.
 *  The priority of the currently running task is never lower
 *  than the priority of any ready task. Conversely, the running task
 *  is preempted and re-scheduled for execution whenever there exists
 *  some ready task of higher priority.
 *
 *  @a(Task Stacks)
 *
 *  When you create a task, it is provided with its own run-time stack,
 *  used for storing local variables as well as for further nesting of
 *  function calls. Each stack must be large enough to handle normal
 *  subroutine calls and one task preemption context.
 *  A task preemption context is the context that gets saved when one task
 *  preempts another as a result of an interrupt thread readying
 *  a higher-priority task.
 *
 *  See sections 3.5.3 and 7.5 of the BIOS User's Guide for further
 *  discussions regarding task stack sizing.
 *
 *  Certain system configuration settings will result in
 *  task stacks needing to be large enough to absorb two interrupt
 *  contexts rather than just one.
 *  Setting {@link ti.sysbios.BIOS#logsEnabled BIOS.logsEnabled} to 'true'
 *  or installing any Task hooks will have the side effect of allowing
 *  up to two interrupt contexts to be placed on a task stack. Also
 *  see {@link #minimizeLatency Task.minimizeLatency}.
 *
 *  @a(Task Deletion)
 *
 *  Any dynamically created task that is not in the Task_Mode_RUNNING
 *  state (ie not the currently running task) can be deleted using the
 *  {@link #delete} API.
 *
 *  Task_delete() removes the task from all internal queues and calls
 *  Memory_free() is used to free the task object and its stack.
 *  Memory_free() must acquire a lock to the memory before proceeding.
 *  If another task already holds a lock to the memory, then the thread
 *  performing the delete will be blocked until the memory is unlocked.
 *
 *  Note:
 *  Task_delete() should be called with extreme care.
 *  As mentioned above, the scope of Task_delete() is limited to
 *  freeing the Task object itself, freeing the task's stack memory
 *  if it was allocated at create time, and removing the task from
 *  any SYS/BIOS-internal state structures.
 *
 *  SYS/BIOS does not keep track of any resources the task may have
 *  acquired or used during its lifetime.
 *
 *  It is the application's responsibility to guarantee the integrity
 *  of a task's partnerships prior to deleting that task.
 *
 *  For example, if a task has obtained exclusive access to a resource,
 *  deleting that task will make the resource forever unavailable.
 *
 *  Task_delete() sets the referenced task handle to NULL. Any subsequent
 *  call to a Task instance API using that null task handle will behave
 *  unpredictably and will usually result in an application crash.
 *
 *  Assuming a task completely cleans up after itself prior to calling
 *  Task_exit() (or falling through the the bottom of the task
 *  function), it is then safest to use Task_delete() only when a task
 *  is in the 'Task_Mode_TERMINATED' state.
 *
 *  Delete hooks:
 *  You can specify application-wide Delete hook functions that
 *  run whenever a task is deleted. See the discussion of Hook Functions
 *  below for details.
 *
 *  Task_delete() constraints:
 *  @p(blist)
 *  -The task cannot be the currently executing task (Task_self()).
 *  -Task_delete cannot be called from a Swi or Hwi.
 *  -No check is performed to prevent Task_delete from being used on a
 *  statically-created object. If a program attempts to delete a task object
 *  that was created statically, the Memory_free() call will result in an
 *  assertion failure in its corresponding Heap manager, causing the
 *  application to exit.
 *  @p
 *
 *  @a(Stack Alignment)
 *
 *  Stack size parameters for both static and dynamic tasks are rounded
 *  up to the nearest integer multiple of a target-specific alignment
 *  requirement.
 *
 *  In the case of Task's which are created with a user-provided stack,
 *  both the base address and the stackSize are aligned. The base address
 *  is increased to the nearest aligned address. The stack size is decreased
 *  accordingly and then rounded down to the nearest integer multiple of the
 *  target-specific required alignment.

 *  <a name="hookfunc"></a>
 *  @p
 *
 *  @a(Hook Functions)
 *
 *  Sets of hook functions can be specified for the Task module.  Each
 *  set can contain these hook functions:
 *  @p(blist)
 *  -Register: A function called before any statically created tasks
 *      are initialized at runtime.  The register hook is called at boot time
 *      before main() and before interrupts are enabled.
 *  -Create: A function that is called when a task is created.
 *      This includes tasks that are created statically and those
 *      created dynamically using {@link #create} or {@link #construct}.
 *      For statically created tasks, create hook is called before main()
 *      and before interrupts are enabled. For dynamically created or
 *      constructed tasks, create hook is called in the same context the
 *      task is created or constructed in i.e. if a task is created in
 *      main(), the create hook is called in main context and if the task
 *      is created within another task, it is called in task context. The
 *      create hook is called outside of a Task_disable/enable block and
 *      before the task has been added to the ready list.
 *  -Ready: A function that is called when a task becomes ready to run.
 *      The ready hook is called in the context of the thread unblocking
 *      a task and therefore it can be called in Hwi, Swi or Task context.
 *      If a Swi or Hwi posts a semaphore that unblocks a task, the ready
 *      hook would be called in the Swi or Hwi's context. The ready hook is
 *      called from within a Task_disable/enable block with interrupts enabled.
 *  -Switch: A function that is called just before a task switch
 *      occurs. The 'prev' and 'next' task handles are passed to the switch
 *      hook. 'prev' is set to NULL for the initial task switch that occurs
 *      during SYS/BIOS startup.  The switch hook is called from within a
 *      Task_disable/enable block with interrupts enabled, in the
 *      context of the task being switched from (ie: the `prev` task).
 *  -Exit: A function that is called when a task exits using {@link #exit}.
 *      It is called in the exiting task's context. The exit hook is passed
 *      the handle of the exiting task. The exit hook is called outside of a
 *      Task_disable/enable block and before the task has been removed from
 *      the kernel lists.
 *  -Delete: A function that is called when any task is deleted at
 *      run-time with {@link #delete}. The delete hook is called in idle task
 *      context if {@link #deleteTerminatedTasks} is set to true. Otherwise,
 *      it is called in the context of the task that is deleting another task.
 *      The delete hook is called outside of a Task_disable/enable block.
 *  @p
 *  Hook functions can only be configured statically.
 *
 *  If you define more than one set of hook functions, all the functions
 *  of a particular type will be run when a Task triggers that type of
 *  hook.
 *
 *  @a(Warning)
 *  Configuring ANY Task hook function will have the side effect of allowing
 *  up to two interrupt contexts beings saved on a task stack. Be careful
 *  to size your task stacks accordingly.
 *
 *  @p(html)
 *  <B>Register Function</B>
 *  @p
 *
 *  The Register function is provided to allow a hook set to store its
 *  hookset ID.  This id can be passed to {@link #setHookContext} and
 *  {@link #getHookContext} to set or get hookset-specific context.  The
 *  Register function must be specified if the hook implementation
 *  needs to use {@link #setHookContext} or {@link #getHookContext}.
 *  The registerFxn hook function is called during system initialization
 *  before interrupts have been enabled.
 *
 *  @p(code)
 *  Void myRegisterFxn(Int id);
 *  @p
 *
 *  @p(html)
 *  <B>Create and Delete Functions</B>
 *  @p
 *
 *  The create and delete functions are called whenever a Task is created
 *  or deleted.  They are called with interrupts enabled (unless called
 *  at boot time or from main()).
 *
 *  @p(code)
 *  Void myCreateFxn(Task_Handle task, Error_Block *eb);
 *  @p
 *
 *  @p(code)
 *  Void myDeleteFxn(Task_Handle task);
 *  @p
 *
 *  @p(html)
 *  <B>Switch Function</B>
 *  @p
 *
 *  If a switch function is specified, it is invoked just before the new task
 *  is switched to.  The switch function is called with interrupts enabled.
 *
 *  This function can be used to save/restore additional task context (for
 *  example, external hardware registers), to check for task stack overflow,
 *  to monitor the time used by each task, etc.
 *
 *  @p(code)
 *  Void mySwitchFxn(Task_Handle prev, Task_Handle next);
 *  @p
 *
 *  To properly handle the switch to the first task your switchFxn should
 *  check for "prev == NULL" before using prev:
 *
 *  @p(code)
 *  Void mySwitchFxn(Task_Handle prev, Task_Handle next)
 *  {
 *      if (prev != NULL) {
 *          ...
 *      }
 *      ...
 *  }
 *  @p
 *
 *  @p(html)
 *  <B>Ready Function</B>
 *  @p
 *
 *  If a ready function is specified, it is invoked whenever a task is made
 *  ready to run.   The ready function is called  with interrupts enabled
 *  (unless called at boot time or from main()).
 *
 *  @p(code)
 *  Void myReadyFxn(Task_Handle task);
 *  @p
 *
 *  @p(html)
 *  <B>Exit Function</B>
 *  @p
 *
 *  If an exit function is specified, it is invoked when a task exits (via
 *  call to Task_exit() or when a task returns from its' main function).
 *  The Exit Function is called with interrupts enabled.
 *
 *  @p(code)
 *  Void myExitFxn(Task_Handle task);
 *  @p

     *  task.  The exit hook is called outside of a Task_disable/enable block
     *  and before the task has been removed from the kernel lists.

     *  Create a Task.
     *
     *  Task_create creates a new task object. If successful, Task_create
     *  returns the handle of the new task object. If unsuccessful,
     *  Task_create returns NULL unless it aborts.
     *
     *  The fxn parameter uses the {@link #FuncPtr} type to pass a pointer to
     *  the function the Task object should run. For example, if myFxn is a
     *  function in your program, your C code can create a Task object
     *  to call that
     *  function as follows:
     *
     *  @p(code)
     *  Task_Params taskParams;
     *
     *  // Create task with priority 15
     *  Task_Params_init(&taskParams);
     *  taskParams.stackSize = 512;
     *  taskParams.priority = 15;
     *  Task_create((Task_FuncPtr)myFxn, &taskParams, &eb);
     *  @p
     *
     *  The following statements statically create a task in the
     *  configuration file:
     *
     *  @p(code)
     *  var params = new Task.Params;
     *  params.instance.name = "tsk0";
     *  params.arg0 = 1;
     *  params.arg1 = 2;
     *  params.priority = 1;
     *  Task.create('&tsk0_func', params);
     *  @p
     *
     *  If NULL is passed instead of a pointer to an actual Task_Params
     *  struct, a
     *  default set of parameters is used. The "eb" is an error block that
     *  you can use
     *  to handle errors that may occur during Task object creation.
     *
     *  The newly created task is placed in {@link #Mode_READY} mode, and is
     *  scheduled to begin concurrent execution of the following function
     *  call:
     *
     *  @p(code)
     *  (*fxn)(arg1, arg2);
     *  @p
     *
     *  As a result of being made ready to run, the task runs any
     *  application-wide Ready functions that have been specified.
     *
     *  Task_exit is automatically called if and when the task returns
     *  from fxn.
     *
     *  @p(html)
     *  <B>Create Hook Functions</B>
     *  @p
     *
     *  You can specify application-wide Create hook functions in your config
     *  file that run whenever a task is created. This includes tasks that
     *  are created statically and those created dynamically using
     *  Task_create.
     *
     *  For Task objects created statically, Create functions are called
     *  during the Task module initialization phase of the program startup
     *  process prior to main().
     *
     *  For Task objects created dynamically, Create functions
     *  are called after the task handle has been initialized but before the
     *  task has been placed on its ready queue.
     *
     *  Any SYS/BIOS function can be called from Create functions.
     *  SYS/BIOS passes the task handle of the task being created to each of
     *  the Create functions.
     *
     *  All Create function declarations should be similar to this:
     *  @p(code)
     *  Void myCreateFxn(Task_Handle task);
     *  @p
     *
     *  @param(fxn)     Task Function

     *  @a(constraints)

     *  ({@link #numPriorities} - 1) and greater than or equal to one (1)
     *  (priority 0 is owned by the Idle task).
     *  - The priority can be set to -1 for tasks that will not execute
     *  until another task changes the priority to a positive value.
     *  - The stackHeap attribute must identify a valid memory Heap.
