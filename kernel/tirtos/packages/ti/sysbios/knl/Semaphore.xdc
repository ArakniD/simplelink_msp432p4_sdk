 *  ======== Semaphore ========
 *  Semaphore Manager
 *
 *  The Semaphore manager makes available a set of functions that manipulate
 *  semaphore objects. Semaphores can be used for task synchronization and
 *  mutual exclusion.
 *
 *  Semaphores can be counting semaphores or binary semaphores. Counting
 *  semaphores keep track of the number of times the semaphore has been posted
 *  with post(). This is useful, for example, if you have a group of resources
 *  that are shared between tasks. Such tasks might call pend() to see if a
 *  resource is available before using one.
 *
 *  Binary semaphores can have only two states: available (count = 1) and
 *  unavailable (count = 0). They can be used to share a single resource
 *  between tasks. They can also be used for a basic signaling mechanism,
 *  where the semaphore can be posted multiple times. Binary semaphores do
 *  not keep track of the count; they simply track whether the semaphore has
 *  been posted or not.
 *
 *  See {@link #getCount Semaphore_getCount()} for more details of the 'count'
 *  behavior.
 *
 *  The Mailbox module uses a counting semaphore internally to manage the
 *  count of free (or full) mailbox elements. Another example of a counting
 *  semaphore is an ISR that might fill multiple buffers of data for
 *  consumption by a task. After filling each buffer, the ISR puts the buffer on
 *  a queue and calls post(). The task waiting for the data calls pend(), which
 *  simply decrements the semaphore count and returns or blocks if the count is
 *  0. The semaphore count thus tracks the number of full buffers available for
 *  the task.
 *
 *  pend() is used to wait for a semaphore. The timeout parameter allows the
 *  task to wait until a timeout, wait indefinitely, or not wait at all. The
 *  return value is used to indicate if the semaphore was signaled successfully.
 *
 *  post() is used to signal a semaphore. If a task is waiting for the
 *  semaphore, post() removes the task from the semaphore queue and puts it on
 *  the ready queue. If no tasks are waiting, post() simply increments the
 *  semaphore count and returns.  For a binary semaphore the count is always
 *  set to one.

     *  point.  This is typically about a dozen instructions per waiting task.
     *  For example, if you have 10 tasks of higher priority waiting, then all
