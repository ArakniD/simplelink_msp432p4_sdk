 * Here is a pseudo image of the initial C6x task stack:
 *
 *  saved-by-callee registers
 *  Task enter()
 *  Task glue()
 *  arg0
 *  arg1
 *  User's task func()
 *  Task_exit()
 *
 * The initial stack consists of the registers that are preserved by a
 * called C function as defined by the C compiler. These are the registers
 * pushed and popped by TaskSupport_swap.
 *
 * Below (or above, depending on your view of the stack) those registers
 * are the Task enter() function which sets up the first invocation of the
 * task in the same manner as if it had been "returned" to from Task_restore()
 * which is the normal path back to an unblocked task.
 *
 * Below the Task enter() function address on the initial task stack is the
 * address of the Glue function. This address is popped by the return from
 * Task enter(). Glue pops the 2 UArgs below it on the stack into the
 * appropriate registers for a fxn(arg0, arg1) call, and then "returns"
 * into the user's task function, which is the next to last address on
 * the stack.
 *
 * Below the Task's function address on the stack is the Task_exit()
 * function address which is returned into if the task function falls
 * out the bottom.
 *
 * The TaskSupport_swap() function pushes all the saved-by-callee
 * registers onto the task stack, then saves the updated SP into
 * the "old" task object's context (SP) address passed to it. Then it
 * loads the "new" task object's context (SP) (the second arg passed
 * to swap) into the SP, unrolls the saved registers and returns into
 * the new task.
 *
 * The pointer returned by the buildTaskStack function is the task's initial
 * stack pointer. This address is stored into the task object's context
 * field and is passed to the TaskSupport_swap() function later.
