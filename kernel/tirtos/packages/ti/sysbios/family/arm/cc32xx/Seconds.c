 *  Macros for accessing RTC registers in 40MHz domain.
 *
 *  The RTC registers in the 40 MHz domain are auto latched. Hence, there is
 *  no requirement to write to latch the RTC values. However, there is a
 *  caveat: If the value is read at the instant the 40 MHz clock and 32.768 KHz
 *  clock aligned, the value read could be erroneous.  As a workaround, the
 *  recommendation is to read the value thrice and identify the right value
 *  (as 2 out the 3 read values will always be correct and with a max. of
 *  1 LSB change).
