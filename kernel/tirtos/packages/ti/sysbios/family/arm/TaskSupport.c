 * Here is a pseudo image of the initial ARM task stack:
 *
 *              Task_enter()
 *              Task_exit()
 *              User's task func()
 *              arg1
 *              arg0
 *              Task_glue()
 *      sp ->   saved-by-callee registers (r4 - r11, lr)
 *
 * The initial stack consists of the registers that are preserved by a
 * called C function as defined by the C compiler. These are the registers
 * pushed and popped by TaskSupport_swap.
 *
 * Below (or above, depending on your view of the stack) those registers
 * is the address of the Glue function. This address is returned to by
 * TaskSupport_Swap(). Glue obtains the Task enter function address from
 * the stack and calls it. The Task enter() function sets up the first
 * entrance to the task in the same manner as if it had been "returned"
 * to from Task_restore() which is the normal path back to an unblocked
 * task.
 *
 * Upon return from the Task enter function, Glue copies the 2 task args
 * from the stack into the appropriate registers for a fxn(arg0, arg1) call,
 * then copies the Task exit function into the lr register, and then calls
 * the user's task function. If the user's task function "falls thru the
 * bottom", the Task exit function contained in the lr register will be
 * "returned" to.
 *
 * The TaskSupport_swap() function pushes all the saved-by-callee
 * registers onto the task stack, then saves the updated SP into
 * the "old" task object's context (SP) address passed to it. Then it
 * loads the "new" task object's context (SP) (the second arg passed
 * to swap) into the SP, unrolls the saved registers and returns into
 * the new task.
 *
 * The pointer returned by the buildTaskStack function is the task's initial
 * stack pointer. This address is stored into the task object's context
 * field and is passed to the TaskSupport_swap() function later.
