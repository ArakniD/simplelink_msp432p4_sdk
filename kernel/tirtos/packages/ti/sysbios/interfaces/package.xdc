 *  ======== ti.sysbios.interfaces ========
 *  Contains all interface specifications.
 *
 *  For the proxy-delegate mechanism between generic modules and the 
 *  modules in {@link ti.sysbios.family} to work properly, both the 
 *  proxy and the delegate modules must be implementations of a common 
 *  interface specification. The Timer, Hwi, Cache and Seconds interface
 *  specifications reside in ti.sysbios.interfaces and are 
 *  {@link ti.sysbios.interfaces.ITimer}, 
 *  {@link ti.sysbios.interfaces.IHwi},
 *  {@link ti.sysbios.interfaces.ICache}, and
 *  {@link ti.sysbios.interfaces.ISeconds} respectively.
 *
 *  These interface specifications define a minimum set of general APIs
 *  that, it is  believed, will satisfy a vast majority of application
 *  requirements. 
 *  
 *  The I<mod>Support interfaces define "internal" interfaces used by the
 *  <mod> modules in their implementation.  These interfaces simplify the
 *  process of porting to a new architecture; one only needs to implement
 *  the I<mod>Support interface to enable the full functionality of the
 *  ti.sysbios.<mod> module.
