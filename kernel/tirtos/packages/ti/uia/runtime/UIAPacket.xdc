     *  UIAPacket Header
     *
     *  The following is a breakdown of the packet header based on type packet.
     *
     *  The packet header is always sent in network byte (big endian) order.
     *
     *  The top 4 leftmost bits of word1 denote what type of packet this is:
     *  HdrType_Msg or HdrType_EventPkt. The contents of the packet depends on
     *  this type.

     * MsgType_ACK:
     * Each packet of type CMD or DATA is immediately acknowledged by
     * sending either an ACK reply (if the packet can be processed),
     * a RESULT or PARTIALRESULT reply (if requested data can be provided
     * immediately) or a NACK reply (if the packet cannot be processed).
     * The Service that receives the command is responsible for sending
     * the ACK or NACK.  If the requested service is not available, the
     * Endpoint is responsible for sending the NACK packet.
     *
     * MsgType_CMD:
     * CMD packets are typically sent from the host to the target.
     * The receiving endpoint routes the command to the service
     * identified in the Service Id field.
     *
     * MsgType_RESULT:
     * RESULT replies are sent along with any requested data.
     * If the Service cannot reply with the requested data immediately,
     * it should return with an ACK packet and send a RESULT packet
     * that echoes the header info of the original command.
     *
     * MsgType_PARTIALRESULT:
     * PARTIALRESULT replies are sent along with any requested data when the
     * requested action can only be partly fulfilled.  Examples are when the
     * service is reporting on some ongoing operation or has been requested
     * to periodically poll some data value.
     *
     * MsgType_EVENT:
     * EVENT packets are sent to all interested parties in order to notify them
     * about state changes.   They can, for example, be used to report an error
     * that has occurred which may impact the ability of the target to continue
     * operating normally.
     *
     * MsgType_FLOWCTRL
     * FLOWCTRL packets are provided for TCF compliance.  They are used to avoid
     * flooding of communication links.  In response, endpoints can either
     * increase or decrease rate of packets sent, although this is only loosely
     * defined. TCF services are not directly concerned with flow control.
     * The data passed with FLOWCTRL packets reports the traffic congestion level
     * as an integer between -100 and 100, where 0 = "optimal load"
     *
     * MsgType_DATA
     * DATA packets are used for sending event log data and other streams of data.
     * Details about how this will be used are being worked out to ensure alignment
     * with BIOS RTA Log Servers.
     *
     * MsgType_NACK_BAD_DATA:
     * Negative Acknowledge due to bad data.  Sent in response to a command that
     * had invalid data in the body of the packet.  The original data is echoed
     * in the NACK response.
     *
     * MsgType_NACK_WITH_ERROR_CODE

     *
     * In general, different compilers will handle bitfields in different \
