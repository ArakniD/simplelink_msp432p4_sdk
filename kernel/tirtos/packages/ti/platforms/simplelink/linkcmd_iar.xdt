% * ======== linkcmd.xdt ========
% *  This is template file is used to generate a linker command file for
% *  executables.  It provides a single place where we can embed information
% *  necessary to load/run executables.
% *
% *  This template is expanded after the configuration script runs and the
% *  results placed in a file (with extension .xdl) associated with the
% *  executable.
% *
% *  Linker templates are passed the following arguments:
% *     $out        - an open file stream for the generated linker
% *                   command file
% *     $args[]     - an array of zero or more libraries that should be linked
% *                   with (in the order they appear in the argument list)
% *
% *  In addition to these arguments, there is a global variable named
% *  'this' that is set as follows:
% *     this        - the program object
