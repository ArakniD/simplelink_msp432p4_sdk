MSP-EXP432P401R LaunchPad's Out Of Box Demo GUI

 1. If you have already used the MSP-EXP432P401R LaunchPad with TI’s Code Composer
    Studio or other IDEs such as Energia, IAR or Keil, then you probably already have the drivers installed.

    The online TI Cloud Tools also installs the LaunchPad driver if you've successfully downloaded
    firmware onto the MSP-EXP432P401R using CCS Cloud.

    If you've not done any of the above, you'll need to install LaunchPad drivers separately before
    using this Out of Box Demo GUI with your LaunchPad. Download and install the XDS Emulation Software Package

    *** Make sure to right click on the installer and click "Run as administrator" ***

 2. Connect the MSP-EXP432P401R to your computer

 3. Make sure the LaunchPad is running the Out Of Box Demo firmware
    If not, the firmware can be downloaded from /Firmware/Binary/OutOfBox_MSP432P401R/
    included in this software package.

 4. Run platform OS specific executable to start the GUI

 5. Click 'Connect'

 6. Click 'Open' to open the serial port. Make sure the COM port being opened
    is the "XDS110 Class Application/User UART"

 7. Change the color and blink frequency of the RGB LED using the color wheel, sliders, and input box!
