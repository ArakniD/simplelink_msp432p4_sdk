</span>    20    <span class="xdoc"> *  Interface implemented by all gate providers
</span>    21    <span class="xdoc"> *
</span>    22    <span class="xdoc"> *  Gates are used within the `xdc.runtime` package to serialize access
</span>    23    <span class="xdoc"> *  to data structures that are used by more than one thread.
</span>    24    <span class="xdoc"> *
</span>    25    <span class="xdoc"> *  Gates are responsible for ensuring that only one out of multiple threads
</span>    26    <span class="xdoc"> *  can access a data structure at a time.  There are important scheduling
</span>    27    <span class="xdoc"> *  latency and performance considerations that affect the "type" of gate used
</span>    28    <span class="xdoc"> *  to protect each data structure.  For example, the best way to protect a
</span>    29    <span class="xdoc"> *  shared counter is to simply disable all interrupts before the update and
</span>    30    <span class="xdoc"> *  restore the interrupt state after the update; disabling all interrupts
</span>    31    <span class="xdoc"> *  prevents all thread switching, so the update is guaranteed to be "atomic".
</span>    32    <span class="xdoc"> *  Although highly efficient, this  method of creating atomic sections causes
</span>    33    <span class="xdoc"> *  serious system latencies when the time required to update the data structure
</span>    34    <span class="xdoc"> *  can't be bounded.
</span>    35    <span class="xdoc"> *
</span>    36    <span class="xdoc"> *  For example, a memory manager's list of free blocks can grow indefinitely
</span>    37    <span class="xdoc"> *  long during periods of high fragmentation.  Searching such a list with
</span>    38    <span class="xdoc"> *  interrupts disabled would cause system latencies to also become unbounded.
</span>    39    <span class="xdoc"> *  In this case, the best solution is to provide a gate that suspends the
</span>    40    <span class="xdoc"> *  execution of  threads that try to enter a gate that has already been
</span>    41    <span class="xdoc"> *  entered; i.e., the gate "blocks" the thread until the thread already in the
</span>    42    <span class="xdoc"> *  gate leaves.  The time required to enter and leave the gate is greater than
</span>    43    <span class="xdoc"> *  simply enabling and restoring interrupts, but since the time spent within
</span>    44    <span class="xdoc"> *  the gate is relatively large, the overhead caused by entering and leaving
</span>    45    <span class="xdoc"> *  gates will not become a significant percentage of overall system time.  More
</span>    46    <span class="xdoc"> *  importantly, threads that do not need to access the shared data structure
</span>    47    <span class="xdoc"> *  are completely unaffected by threads that do access it.
</span>    48    <span class="xdoc"> *
</span>    49    <span class="xdoc"> *  <b>@a(Notes)</b>
</span>    50    <span class="xdoc"> *  Modules inheriting this interface should treat all names beginning with
</span>    51    <span class="xdoc"> *  `Q_` as reserved words, i.e. the names from that namespace should not
</span>    52    <span class="xdoc"> *  be used.  This will allow future version of this interface to define new
</span>    53    <span class="xdoc"> *  constants ("qualities" ) similar to `{<b>@link</b> #Q_BLOCKING}` and
