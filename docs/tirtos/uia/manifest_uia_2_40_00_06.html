<div style="text-align: center;"><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Eclipse Public License - v 1.0 </span><br><br>THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE<br>PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF<br>THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.<br><br>*1. DEFINITIONS*<br><br>"Contribution" means:<br><br>a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and<br>documentation distributed under this Agreement, and<br><br>b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:<br><br>i) changes to the Program, and<br><br>ii) additions to the Program;<br><br>where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and<br>are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution<br>'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such<br>Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.<br>Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are<br>separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program<br>under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of<br>the Program.<br><br>"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.<br><br>"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which<br>are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone<br>or when combined with the Program.<br><br>"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this<br>Agreement.<br><br>"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,<br>including all Contributors.<br><br>*2. GRANT OF RIGHTS*<br><br>a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby<br>grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright<br>license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,<br>publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such<br>Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and<br>object code form.<br><br>b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby<br>grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license<br>under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and<br>otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in<br>source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the<br>combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the<br>Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the<br>Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed<br>Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations<br>which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.<br><br>c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the<br>licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are<br>provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the<br>patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each<br>Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by<br>any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights<br>or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses<br>granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to<br>secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For<br>example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient<br>to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire<br>that license before distributing the Program.<br><br>d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient<br>copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright<br>license set forth in this Agreement.<br><br>*3. REQUIREMENTS*<br><br>A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form<br>under its own license agreement, provided that:<br><br>a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and<br><br>b) its license agreement:<br><br>i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties<br>and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions<br>of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of<br>merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;<br><br>ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for<br>damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and<br>consequential damages, such as lost profits;<br><br>iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are<br>offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and<br><br>iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such<br>Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable<br>manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.<br><br>When the Program is made available in source code form:<br><br>a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and<br><br>b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.<br><br>Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained<br>within the Program.<br><br>Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its<br>Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent<br>Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.<br><br>*4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION*<br><br>Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities<br>with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this<br>license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the<br>Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering<br>should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for<br>other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in<br>a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial<br>Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other<br>Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and<br>costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other<br>legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified<br>Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such<br>Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the<br>Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this<br>section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or<br>alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an<br>Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial<br>Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial<br>Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor<br>in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified<br>Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.<br><br>For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial<br>product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial<br>Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance<br>claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance<br>claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility<br>alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to<br>defend claims against the other Contributors related to those<br>performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other<br>Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor<br>must pay those damages.<br><br>*5. NO WARRANTY*<br><br>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED<br>ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,<br>EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES<br>OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR<br>A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for<br>determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program<br>and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this<br>Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program<br>errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,<br>programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.<br><br>*6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY*<br><br>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR<br>ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,<br>INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING<br>WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF<br>LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING<br>NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR<br>DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED<br>HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br><br>*7. GENERAL*<br><br>If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under<br>applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of<br>the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action<br>by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum<br>extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.<br><br>If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including<br>a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program<br>itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or<br>hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's<br>rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such<br>litigation is filed.<br><br>All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails<br>to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement<br>and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after<br>becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under<br>this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution<br>of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's<br>obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient<br>relating to the Program shall continue and survive.<br><br>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,<br>but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may<br>only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves<br>the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this<br>Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has<br>the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the<br>initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the<br>responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate<br>entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing<br>version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be<br>distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was<br>received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is<br>published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including<br>its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in<br>Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses<br>to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,<br>whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in<br>the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.<br><br>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the<br>intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to<br>this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than<br>one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights<br>to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.<br>
