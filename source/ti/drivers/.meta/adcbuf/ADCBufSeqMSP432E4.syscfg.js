When __Auto__ is selected, automatically and continuously trigger ADC sampling.
Precaution should be taken when using this mode with multiple sequencers.
If the sequencer's priority using the software trigger is too high, it is
possible to starve other lower priority sequencers. Generally, a sequencer
using __Auto__ should be set to the lowest sequencer priority.

When __Timer__ is selected, trigger ADC samples using a general purpose timer.
When using both ADC peripherals, both will use the same general
purpose timer.
