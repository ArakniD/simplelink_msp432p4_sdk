Specifies the phase delay between a trigger and the start of a sequence for

modules (such as __0__ and __180__) and having each ADC module sample the
same analog input, it is possible to increase the sampling rate of the analog
input (with samples N, N+2, N+4, and so on, coming from the first ADC and
samples N+1, N+3, N+5, and so on, coming from the second ADC). The ADC module
has a single phase delay that is applied to all sample sequences within that
module.
