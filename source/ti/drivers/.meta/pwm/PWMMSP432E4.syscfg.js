A PWM generator can count in two different modes: count down mode or count 
up/down mode.  In count down mode, it counts from a value down to zero, 
and then resets to the preset value, producing left-aligned PWM signals 
(that is, the rising edge of the two PWM signals produced by the generator 
occur at the same time).  In count up/down mode, it counts up from zero 
to the preset value, counts back down to zero, and then repeats the process, 
producing center-aligned PWM signals (that is, the middle of the high/low 
period of the PWM signals produced by the generator occurs at the same time).

When the PWM generator parameters (period and pulse width) are modified, their 
effect on the output PWM signals can be delayed.  In synchronous mode, the 
parameter updates are not applied until a synchronization event occurs. This 
mode allows multiple parameters to be modified and take effect simultaneously, 
instead of one at a time. Additionally, parameters to multiple PWM generators 
in synchronous mode can be updated simultaneously, allowing them to be treated 
as if they were a unified generator. In non-synchronous mode, the parameter 
updates are not delayed until a synchronization event. In either mode, the 
parameter updates only occur when the counter is at zero to help prevent oddly 
formed PWM signals during the update (that is, a PWM pulse that is too short 
or too long).

The PWM generator can either pause or continue running when the processor is 
stopped via the debugger. If configured to pause, it continues to count until 
it reaches zero, at which point it pauses until the processor is restarted. If 
configured to continue running, it keeps counting as if nothing had happened.
