/*
 * The I2C address for the INA226 is determinable via by the BoosterPack
 * schematics [1] and section "7.5.5.1 Serial Bus Address" of the INA226
 * data sheet [2].
 *
 * Address pin A1 of the INA226 is tied to ground and A0 is tied to pin 27
 * of the standard BoosterPack 40 pin header and is, therefore, controllable
 * by the connected LaunchPad.  For this configuration, the INA226 datasheet
 * documents the I2C address to be either
 *     o 0x40 if pin 27 is driven to ground, or
 *     o 0x41 if pin 27 is driven high
 *
 * Note: The BoosterPack standard normally requires pin 27 to be used for
 *       Analog input.
 *
 * Section 7.5.5.2 Serial Interface states 
 *     "The INA226 supports the transmission protocol for fast mode (1 kHz
 *     to 400 kHz) and high-speed mode (1 kHz to 2.94 MHz). All data bytes
 *     are transmitted most significant byte first."
