These routines are typically used in computationally intensive real-time applications where optimal execution speed, high accuracy and ultra-low energy are critical. By using the IQmath and Qmath libraries, it is possible to achieve execution speeds considerably faster and energy consumption considerably lower than equivalent code written using floating-point math.</p>"

These examples are similar to the examples in examples/rtos and examples/nortos but they use SysConfig to generate configuration code instead of having the application provide it. SysConfig is integrated with logic to help manage, expose and potentially solve conflicts visually to free up more time for creating differentiated applications. Use of the SysConfig preview examples is not required for developing on SimpleLink devices. However, we encourage you to try them out and to give us your feedback. More information on SysConfig can be found in the SysConfig section of the SimpleLink MCU SDK User's Guide. See the \"System Configuration Basics\" lab in <a href='http://www.ti.com/wireless-connectivity/simplelink-solutions/overview/simplelink-academy.html'>SimpleLink Academy</a> for step-by-step instructions for installing and using SysConfig</p>"
