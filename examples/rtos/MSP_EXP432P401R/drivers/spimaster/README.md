## Example Summary

Demonstrates how to use SPI driver in master mode to communicate with another
SimpleLink device. To run this example successfully, another SimpleLink
device running the `spislave` example is required.

## Peripherals & Pin Assignments

SysConfig generates the driver configurations into the __ti_drivers_config.c__
and __ti_drivers_config.h__ files. Information on pins and resources used
is present in both generated files. The SysConfig user interface can also be
utilized to determine pins and resources used.

* `CONFIG_SPI_MASTER` - SPI peripheral assigned as a master
* `CONFIG_SPI_MASTER_READY` - GPIO managed by master to notify the slave
`CONFIG_SPI_MASTER` has been opened
* `CONFIG_SPI_SLAVE_READY` - GPIO to notify the master the slave is ready for a
transfer
* `CONFIG_GPIO_LED_0` - Indicator LED
* `CONFIG_GPIO_LED_1` - Indicator LED

## BoosterPacks, Board Resources & Jumper Settings

This example requires 2 LaunchPads.

For board specific jumper settings, resources and BoosterPack modifications,
refer to the __Board.html__ file.

> If you're using an IDE such as Code Composer Studio (CCS) or IAR, please
refer to Board.html in your project directory for resources used and
board-specific jumper settings.

The Board.html can also be found in your SDK installation:

        <SDK_INSTALL_DIR>/source/ti/boards/<BOARD>

Before running the example the following pins must be connected between master
& slave devices.

  |      SPI Master LaunchPad      |      SPI Slave LaunchPad      |
  |:------------------------------:|:-----------------------------:|
  | __`CONFIG_SPI_MASTER` `CLK`__  | __`CONFIG_SPI_SLAVE` `CLK`__  |
  | __`CONFIG_SPI_MASTER` `MOSI`__ | __`CONFIG_SPI_SLAVE` `MOSI`__ |
  | __`CONFIG_SPI_MASTER` `MISO`__ | __`CONFIG_SPI_SLAVE` `MISO`__ |
  | __`CONFIG_SPI_MASTER` `CS`__   | __`CONFIG_SPI_SLAVE` `CS`__   |
  | __`CONFIG_SPI_MASTER_READY`__  | __`CONFIG_SPI_MASTER_READY`__ |
  | __`CONFIG_SPI_SLAVE_READY`__   | __`CONFIG_SPI_SLAVE_READY`__  |

> The SPI can be used in 4-pin or 3-pin modes (chip select is optional).  When
running this example SPI peripherals on both SimpleLink devices must align on
chip select use.  Users must verify before running the example.

> Although not in the table above, a ground jumper must also be connected
between both boards.


## Example Usage

* Example output is generated through use of Display driver APIs. Refer to the
Display driver documentation found in the SimpleLink MCU SDK User's Guide.

* Open a serial session (e.g. [`PuTTY`](http://www.putty.org/ "PuTTY's
Homepage"), etc.) to the appropriate COM port.
    * The COM port can be determined via Device Manager in Windows or via
`ls /dev/tty*` in Linux.

The connection will have the following settings:
```
    Baud-rate:     115200
    Data bits:          8
    Stop bits:          1
    Parity:          None
    Flow Control:    None
```

* Run the example. `CONFIG_GPIO_LED_0` turns ON to show the example is running.

* Once the slave is running, master & slave devices will exchange messages in
a loop.  While the SPI transactions are taking place, `CONFIG_GPIO_LED_1` will
toggle on/off indicating transfers are occurring. After a transfer is complete,
the messages are printed via UART. The loop is repeated `MAX_LOOP` times.

Messages should appear as follows:
```
    Starting the SPI master example
    This example requires external wires to be connected to the header pins. Please see the Board.html for details.

    Master SPI initialized

    Master received: Hello from slave, msg#: 0
    Master received: Hello from slave, msg#: 1
    Master received: Hello from slave, msg#: 2
    Master received: Hello from slave, msg#: 3
    Master received: Hello from slave, msg#: 4
    Master received: Hello from slave, msg#: 5
    Master received: Hello from slave, msg#: 6
    Master received: Hello from slave, msg#: 7
    Master received: Hello from slave, msg#: 8
    Master received: Hello from slave, msg#: 9

    Done
```

## Application Design Details

This application uses a single thread:

`masterThread` - creates the master SPI message, opens `CONFIG_SPI_MASTER` and
waits for the slave to be ready for a SPI transfer.  When the slave is ready it
starts the transfer.  Once complete, the master prepares the next transaction
& waits for the slave once more.  A total of `MAX_LOOP` SPI transactions are
performed in this manner.

The `masterThread` performs the following actions:

1.  Before performing transfers, we must make sure both, `spimaster` &
`spislave` applications are synchronized with each other.  The master will set
`CONFIG_SPI_MASTER_READY` to 1 to notify the slave it is ready to synchronize.
The master will then wait for the slave to pull `CONFIG_SPI_SLAVE_READY` high in
acknowledgment.

2.  Opens `CONFIG_SPI_MASTER` & sets `CONFIG_SPI_MASTER_READY` to 0.  Setting
`CONFIG_SPI_MASTER_READY` will notify the slave `CONFIG_SPI_MASTER` has been
opened.

3.  Waits for the slave to be ready for the SPI transfer.  The slave will pull
`CONFIG_SPI_SLAVE_READY` low when ready for a transfer.

4. Creates a SPI transaction structure and sets txBuffer to `Hello from
master, msg# n`, where n is the iteration number.

5. Toggles `CONFIG_GPIO_LED_1`.

6. Transfers the message. If the transfer is successful, the message
received from the slave SPI is printed. Otherwise, an error message
is printed.

7. Sleeps for 3 seconds.

8. Repeats from step 3 for `MAX_LOOP` iterations.

9. Closes the SPI driver object and terminates execution.

TI-RTOS:

* When building in Code Composer Studio, the kernel configuration project will
be imported along with the example. The kernel configuration project is
referenced by the example, so it will be built first. The "release" kernel
configuration is the default project used. It has many debug features disabled.
These feature include assert checking, logging and runtime stack checks. For a
detailed difference between the "release" and "debug" kernel configurations and
how to switch between them, please refer to the SimpleLink MCU SDK User's
Guide. The "release" and "debug" kernel configuration projects can be found
under &lt;SDK_INSTALL_DIR&gt;/kernel/tirtos/builds/&lt;BOARD&gt;/(release|debug)/(ccs|gcc).

FreeRTOS:

* Please view the `FreeRTOSConfig.h` header file for example configuration
information.
