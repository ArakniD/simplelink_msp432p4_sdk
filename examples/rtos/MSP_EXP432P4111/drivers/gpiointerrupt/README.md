## Example Summary

Application that toggles an LED(s) using a GPIO pin interrupt.

## Peripherals & Pin Assignments

SysConfig generates the driver configurations into the __ti_drivers_config.c__
and __ti_drivers_config.h__ files. Information on pins and resources used
is present in both generated files. The SysConfig user interface can also be
utilized to determine pins and resources used.

* `CONFIG_GPIO_LED_0` - Indicates that the board was initialized within
`mainThread()` also toggled by `CONFIG_GPIO_BUTTON_0`
* `CONFIG_GPIO_LED_1` - Toggled by `CONFIG_GPIO_BUTTON_1`
* `CONFIG_GPIO_BUTTON_0` - Toggles `CONFIG_GPIO_LED_0`
* `CONFIG_GPIO_BUTTON_1` - Toggles `CONFIG_GPIO_LED_1`

## BoosterPacks, Board Resources & Jumper Settings

For board specific jumper settings, resources and BoosterPack modifications,
refer to the __Board.html__ file.

> If you're using an IDE such as Code Composer Studio (CCS) or IAR, please
refer to Board.html in your project directory for resources used and
board-specific jumper settings.

The Board.html can also be found in your SDK installation:

        <SDK_INSTALL_DIR>/source/ti/boards/<BOARD>

## Example Usage

* Run the example. `CONFIG_GPIO_LED_0` turns ON to indicate driver
initialization is complete.

* `CONFIG_GPIO_LED_0` is toggled by pushing `CONFIG_GPIO_BUTTON_0`.
* `CONFIG_GPIO_LED_1` is toggled by pushing `CONFIG_GPIO_BUTTON_1`.

## Application Design Details

* The `gpioButtonFxn0/1` functions are configured in the driver configuration
file. These functions are called in the context of the GPIO interrupt.

* Not all boards have more than one button, so `CONFIG_GPIO_LED_1` may not be
toggled.

* There is no button de-bounce logic in the example.

TI-RTOS:

* When building in Code Composer Studio, the configuration project will be
imported along with the example. These projects can be found under
\<SDK_INSTALL_DIR>\/kernel/tirtos/builds/\<BOARD\>/(release|debug)/(ccs|gcc).
The configuration project is referenced by the example, so it
will be built first. The "release" configuration has many debug features
disabled. These features include assert checking, logging and runtime stack
checks. For a detailed difference between the "release" and "debug"
configurations, please refer to the TI-RTOS Kernel User's Guide.

FreeRTOS:

* Please view the `FreeRTOSConfig.h` header file for example configuration
information.
