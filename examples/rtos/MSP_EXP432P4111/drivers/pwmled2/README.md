## Example Summary

Sample application to control on-board LEDs with the PWM driver.

## Peripherals & Pin Assignments

SysConfig generates the driver configurations into the __ti_drivers_config.c__
and __ti_drivers_config.h__ files. Information on pins and resources used
is present in both generated files. The SysConfig user interface can also be
utilized to determine pins and resources used.


* `CONFIG_PWM_0` - PWM instance used to control brightness of LED
* `CONFIG_PWM_1` - PWM instance used to control brightness of LED

## BoosterPacks, Board Resources & Jumper Settings

For board specific jumper settings, resources and BoosterPack modifications,
refer to the __Board.html__ file.

> If you're using an IDE such as Code Composer Studio (CCS) or IAR, please
refer to Board.html in your project directory for resources used and
board-specific jumper settings.

The Board.html can also be found in your SDK installation:

        <SDK_INSTALL_DIR>/source/ti/boards/<BOARD>

## Example Usage

* Run the example.

* The onboard LEDs will slowly vary in intensity.

* Both LEDs connected to `CONFIG_PWM_0` and `CONFIG_PWM_1` will fade-in and
  fade-out when running the application.

## Application Design Details

This application uses one thread, `mainThread` , which performs the following
actions:

1. Opens and initializes PWM driver objects.

2. Uses the PWM driver to change the intensity of the LEDs.

3. The thread sleeps for 50 milliseconds before changing LED intensity again.

TI-RTOS:

* When building in Code Composer Studio, the kernel configuration project will
be imported along with the example. The kernel configuration project is
referenced by the example, so it will be built first. The "release" kernel
configuration is the default project used. It has many debug features disabled.
These feature include assert checking, logging and runtime stack checks. For a
detailed difference between the "release" and "debug" kernel configurations and
how to switch between them, please refer to the SimpleLink MCU SDK User's
Guide. The "release" and "debug" kernel configuration projects can be found
under &lt;SDK_INSTALL_DIR&gt;/kernel/tirtos/builds/&lt;BOARD&gt;/(release|debug)/(ccs|gcc).

FreeRTOS:

* Please view the `FreeRTOSConfig.h` header file for example configuration
information.
