 *  ======== overSampleADC.c ========
 *  This file contains the following:
 *  
 *  ADCBuf callback
 *      The ADCBuf callback function is called everytime either the 'ping' or 
 *      'pong' of the DMA is completed.  Within the callback the number of 
 *      callbacks is monitored and passed along with the address of the most
 *      recent data array through the message queue to the calculation thread.
 *      The idea is that the acquisition size can exceed the 1024 DMA size
 *      limit by managing the transfers and performing cumulative computations
 *      until the desired data set size is acquired. The usage of the
 *      'no block' message queue flag ensures that the queue does not pend
 *      within the ISR.
 * 
 *  measurementThread
 *      The measurement thread initializes the GPIO, ADC/DMA and the diplay
 *      driver.  Two semaphores are used to control the flow of the program:
 *      startMeasure and completeMeasure.
 *      The startMeasure is posted from the GPIO callback (hwi) and starts the
 *      measurement, the next measurement will not start until the GPIO posts
 *      again.  The measurementComplete is posted from computationThread and
 *      indicates that both the ADC/DMA as well as the computation is complete
 *      and that the data can be presented to the display.  The ADC and the
 *      display are both closed and the power constraint is released to allow
 *      the device to enter sleep (LPM0)while waiting for the next GPIO hwi.
 *
