 *                       MSP432 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP432 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see http://www.ti.com/tool/mspdriverlib for an API functional
 * library & https://dev.ti.com/pinmux/ for a GUI approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP432P401 Demo - Use SysTick to measure cycle count of a function
//
//  Description: Use SysTick to count the number of clock cycles elapsed in a
//  function. Note that for extremely intensive function/code that might
//  take more than 2^24 CPU cycles to complete, SysTick will overflow. An
//  interrupt service routine is used to track the number of overflows.
//  Interrupt latency and ISR execution (one C instruction) are not accounted
//  for in the calculation since they are small and can be negligible (compared
//  to multiples of 2^24 cycles)
