 *                       MSP432 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP432 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see http://www.ti.com/tool/mspdriverlib for an API functional
 * library & https://dev.ti.com/pinmux/ for a GUI approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP432P401 Demo - SysTick used in interval mode
//
//  Description: SysTick is configured to count down from 0x20000 to 0. At 0,
//  the SysTick count gets reloaded to the original 0x20000 value to repeat the
//  process. An interrupt is also configured to trigger when the SysTick count
//  gets down to 0. P1.0 LED is toggled in the SysTick interrupt service routine.
