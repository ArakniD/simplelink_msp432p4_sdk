 *                       MSP432 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP432 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see http://www.ti.com/tool/mspdriverlib for an API functional
 * library & https://dev.ti.com/pinmux/ for a GUI approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP432P401 Demo - ADC14, Sample A1, AVcc Ref, Set P1.0 if A1 > 0.5*AVcc
//
//   Description: A single sample is made on A1 with reference to AVcc.
//   Software sets ADC14_CTL0_SC to start sample and conversion - ADC14_CTL0_SC
//   automatically cleared at EOC. ADC14 internal oscillator times sample (16x)
//   and conversion. In Mainloop MSP432 waits in LPM0 to save power until ADC14
//   conversion complete, ADC14_ISR will force exit from LPM0 in Mainloop on
//   reti. If A1 > 0.5*AVcc, P1.0 set, else reset. The full, correct handling of
//   and ADC14 interrupt is shown as well.
