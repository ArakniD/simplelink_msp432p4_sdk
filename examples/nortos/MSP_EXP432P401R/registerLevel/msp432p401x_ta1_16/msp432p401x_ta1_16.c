 *                       MSP432 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP432 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see http://www.ti.com/tool/mspdriverlib for an API functional
 * library & https://dev.ti.com/pinmux/ for a GUI approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP432P401 Demo - Timer1_A3, PWM TA1.1-2, Up Mode, DCO SMCLK
//
//  Description: This program generates two PWM outputs on P7.6, P7.7 using
//  Timer1_A configured for up mode. The value in CCR0, 1000-1, defines the PWM
//  period and the values in CCR1 and CCR2 the PWM duty cycles. Using ~3MHz
//  SMCLK as TACLK, the timer period is ~1ms with a 75% duty cycle on P7.7
//  and 25% on P7.6.
//  ACLK = n/a, SMCLK = MCLK = TACLK = 3MHz
//
