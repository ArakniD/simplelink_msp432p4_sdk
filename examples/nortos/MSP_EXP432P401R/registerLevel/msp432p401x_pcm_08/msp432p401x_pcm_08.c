 *                       MSP432 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP432 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see http://www.ti.com/tool/mspdriverlib for an API functional
 * library & https://dev.ti.com/pinmux/ for a GUI approach to peripheral configuration.

//   MSP432P401 Demo - Use DC-DC Regulator
//
//
//   Description: Configure PCM module to use the DC-DC regulator instead of
//   the default LDO. Note that DC-DC usage requires a 4.7uH inductor connected
//   between VSW and VCORE pins. VCORE pin still requires its regular 100nF and
//   4.7uF capacitors.
//
//   Note: the code in this example assumes the device is currently in LDO mode
//   AM_LDO_VCORE0 or AM_LDO_VCORE1 (Active Mode using LDO, VCore=0/1 respectively)
//
//   Transition from DCDC mode to Low-Frequency Mode requires intermediate
//   transition through LDO mode. For more information refer to the PCM chapter
//   in the device user's guide.
//
//   AM_DCDC_VCORE1  <--@-->  AM_LDO_VCORE1  <-----> AM_LF_VCORE1
//                                  ^
//                                  |
//                                  @
//                                  |
//                                  v
//   AM_DCDC_VCORE0  <----->  AM_LDO_VCORE0* <-----> AM_LF_VCORE0
//
//   *: power state condition after reset
//   @: transitions demonstrated in this code example
