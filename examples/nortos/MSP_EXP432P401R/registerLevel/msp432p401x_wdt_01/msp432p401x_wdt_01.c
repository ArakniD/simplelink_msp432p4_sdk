 *                       MSP432 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP432 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see http://www.ti.com/tool/mspdriverlib for an API functional
 * library & https://dev.ti.com/pinmux/ for a GUI approach to peripheral configuration.

//   MSP432P401 Demo - WDT, Toggle P1.0, Interval Overflow ISR, DCO SMCLK
//
//  Description:  Toggle P1.0 using software timed by the WDT ISR. Toggle rate
//  is approximately 10ms = {(3MHz) / 32768} based on DCO = 3MHz
//  clock source used in this example for the WDT.
//  ACLK = n/a, SMCLK = 3MHz
//
