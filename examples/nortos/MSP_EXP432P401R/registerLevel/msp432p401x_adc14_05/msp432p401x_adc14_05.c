 *                       MSP432 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP432 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see http://www.ti.com/tool/mspdriverlib for an API functional
 * library & https://dev.ti.com/pinmux/ for a GUI approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP432P401 Demo - ADC14, Using an External Reference
//
//  Description: This example shows how to use an external positive reference for
//  the ADC14.The external reference is applied to the VeREF+ pin. VeREF- is used
//  for the negative reference (use an external jumper to GND). A single
//  conversion is performed on channel A0. The conversion results are stored in
//  ADC14->MEM[0]. Test by applying a voltage to channel A0, then setting and
//  running to a break point at the "_NOP()" instruction. To view the conversion
//  results, open an SFR window in debugger and view the contents of
//  ADC14->MEM[0] or from the variable ADCvar.
//  NOTE: VeREF+ range: 1.4V (min) to AVCC (max)
//        VeREF- range: 0V (min) to 1.2V (max)
//        Differential ref voltage range: 1.4V(min) to AVCC(max)
//          (see datasheet for device specific information)
