 *                       MSP432 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP432 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see http://www.ti.com/tool/mspdriverlib for an API functional
 * library & https://dev.ti.com/pinmux/ for a GUI approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP432P401 Demo - ADC14, Repeated Sequence of Conversions
//
//  Description: This example shows how to perform a repeated sequence of
//  conversions using "repeat sequence-of-channels" mode.  AVcc is used for the
//  reference and repeated sequence of conversions is performed on Channels A0,
//  A1, A2, and A3. Each conversion result is stored in ADC14->MEM[0], ADC14->MEM[1],
//  ADC14->MEM[2], and ADC14->MEM[3] respectively. After each sequence, the 4 conversion
//  results are moved to A0results[], A1results[], A2results[], and A3results[].
//  Test by applying voltages to channels A0 - A3. Open a watch window in
//  debugger and view the results. Set Breakpoint1 in the index increment line
//  to see the array values change sequentially and Breakpoint2 to see the entire
//  array of conversion results in A0results[], A1results[], A2results[], and
//  A3results[]for the specified Num_of_Results.
//
//  Note that a sequence has no restrictions on which channels are converted.
//  For example, a valid sequence could be A0, A3, A2, A4, A2, A1, A0, and A7.
//  See the User's Guide for instructions on using the ADC14.
