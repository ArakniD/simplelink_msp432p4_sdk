 *                       MSP432 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP432 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see http://www.ti.com/tool/mspdriverlib for an API functional
 * library & https://dev.ti.com/pinmux/ for a GUI approach to peripheral configuration.

//   MSP432P401 Demo - WDT Failsafe Clock, WDT mode, DCO SMCLK
//
//  Description: Allow WDT+ in watchdog mode to timeout in ~175ms. Upon reset,
//  the application toggles P1.0 in main function. LPM3 is entered,
//  this example will demonstrate WDT feature of preventing WDT clock to be
//  disabled. The WDT will not allow active WDT clock to be be disabled by
//  software, the LED continues to Flash because the WDT times out normally
//  (in 32768 DCOCLK cycles) even though software has attempted to disable
//  WDT+ clock source.
//  ACLK = n/a, MCLK = SMCLK = default DCO
//
