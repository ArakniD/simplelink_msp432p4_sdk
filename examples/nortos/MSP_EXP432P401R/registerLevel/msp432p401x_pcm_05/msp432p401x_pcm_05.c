 *                       MSP432 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP432 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see http://www.ti.com/tool/mspdriverlib for an API functional
 * library & https://dev.ti.com/pinmux/ for a GUI approach to peripheral configuration.

//   MSP432P401 Demo - Enter Low-Frequency Active mode
//
//
//   Description: Use low-frequency mode for low-frequency low-power CPU
//   operation. For more LF examples, refer to msp432_pcm_06, which is
//   based on code example and demonstrates peripheral operation (TimerA) in
//   LF mode. For LF LPM0 example, refer to msp432_pcm_06 for TimerA
//   operation in LF_LPM0.
//
//   Note: the code in this example assumes the device is currently in LDO mode
//   AM0_LDO or AM1_LDO (Active Mode using LDO, VCore=0/1 respectively)
//
//   Transition from DCDC mode to LF mode requires intermediate transition through
//   LDO mode. For more information refer to the PCM chapter in the device user's
//   guide.
//
//          AM1_DCDC <----->  AM1_LDO  <--@--> AM1_LF
//                               ^
//                               |

//          AM0_DCDC <----->  AM0_LDO* <--@--> AM0_LF
//
//   *: power state condition after reset
