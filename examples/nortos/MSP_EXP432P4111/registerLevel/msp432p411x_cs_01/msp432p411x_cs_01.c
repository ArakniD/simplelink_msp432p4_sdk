 *                       MSP432 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP432 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see MSP432 SDK http://www.ti.com/tool/simplelink-msp432-sdk
 * for an API library & https://dev.ti.com/pinmux/ for a GUI-based approach
 * to peripheral configuration.
